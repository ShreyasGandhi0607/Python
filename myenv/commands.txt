The "requirements.txt" file

In addition to creating and activating a virtual environment, 
it can be useful to create a requirements.txt file that lists the packages 
and their versions that your project depends on. This file can be used to easily 
install all the required packages in a new environment.

To create a requirements.txt file, you can use the pip 
freeze command, which outputs a list of installed packages 
and their versions. For example:

# Output the list of installed packages and their versions to a file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

To install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file,
 you can use the pip install command with the -r flag:

# Install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

Using a virtual environment and a requirements.txt 
file can help you manage the dependencies for your Python 
projects and ensure that your projects are portable and can be 
easily set up on a new machine.
